Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

R: Initializing a repository creates a hidden git file. This hidden git file is important 
because it tracks all the different snapshots or commits of your group of files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value
do you think it offers?

R: The staging area is the intermediary between the working directory and the repository. It 
holds the files that you are ready to commit to the repository. This staging area allows for 
flexibility in deciding which files to commit. Without it, every commit would take a snapshot
of every file in the working directory which may be undesirable.
