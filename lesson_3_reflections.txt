Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

R: Having a remote repository can help save my work in case my computer crashes. It also allows
me to collaborate with other people.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

R: This way I can keep my work private before pushing it so that others can see it. It allows 
me to push when I feel my work is ready to be made public.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When should you use one 
instead of another?

R: Forks are clones of repositories directly on github. Clones are more general and are copies 
of any repository. Branches are different versions of files within a repository itself. 
Branches can be used to make experimental changes to a group of files. Clones can be used so 
that someone else can also make changes to a group of files in their own repository. Forks can 
be used to copy someone's repository and make changes to those files on your own without 
altering their files.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

R: Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally let's us fetch and make 
changes without merging right away to the actual branch. A local copy of the remote branch 
also allows us to make changes which will be able to merge with a remote repository when 
trying to pull.
